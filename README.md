# minecraft_plugins

This repository contains the source code for a multitude of plugins for Spigot, Bukkit and BungeeCord I wrote around 2015 for personal projects. I have decided to make them public in case anyone finds them useful.

#### Disclaimer

I do not guarantee that any of these plugins will work, or that they will work as intended. I have not tested them in a long time, and I do not intend to do so. I am not responsible for any damage caused by these plugins. Use at your own risk.

#### Credits

If there are any files or parts of the code that are not mine, please let me know and I will remove them. I do not intend to steal anyone's work, and I will not take credit for something I did not create. As this is old work, I do not remember where I got some of the code from, so I apologize in advance if I have used your code without permission.
